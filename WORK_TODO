1. Fill out struct Table_Time_Statistics
2. make struct log in log.h, it is empty right now and TABLE uses it
3. Inside library/table/table.h, 
   the macro Data_XXX_Information_Struct_Gen, generates the desired struct
   but does not format it well (it lacks newlines after the variable decls
   inside the struct). Find out how to make it generate the struct with 
   newlines.
4. Find a balance between EMBEDDED_DATA, TABLE, and LOG. TABLE and LOG use EMBEDDED_DATA
   and EMBEDDED_DATA has DATA_ALTERATION_INFORMATION, while TABLE has 
   TABLE_DATA_ALTERATION_INFORMATION, we are thinking about changing this to
   TABLE_ENTRY_ALTERATION_INFORMATION since we discussed it a bit, and EMBEDDED_DATA 
   should be in bulk bytes and TABLE should be in entries
