GCC macro expansion is not that great when it comes to concatenation,
here is an example. note: "##" is used for concatenation
	#define Test_XXX(XXX) ##XXX_Test
	Test_XXX(ABC);

The above code produces the following result:
	XXX_Test;

The passed parameter "ABC" is not concatenated due to the lack of 
whitespace isolation around "##XXX".

You can get the concatenation to work, in the above example the following
would produce the desired result:
	#define Test_XXX(XXX) ##XXX _Test
	Test_XXX(ABC);

But as you can see it can be confusing because we put a space between
"##XXX" and "_Test", yet the preprocessor will produce a result which
omits the space: 
	ABC_XXX;

A better way to do this would be to replace the macro parameters in the
macro value if it is prepended with a "##" even if it is NOT whitespace
isolated.

The above was inspired by attempting to create the macro
Data_XXX_Information_Struct_Gen, this macro can be found in 
library/Tests/table/macros/Data_XXX_Information_Struct_Gen.c, the macro
was created successfully, but it follows the above pattern of having to
include whitespace inbetween the strings to be concatenated.
