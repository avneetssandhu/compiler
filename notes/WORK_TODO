1. Fill out struct Table_Time_Statistics
2. make struct log in log.h, it is empty right now and TABLE uses it
3. Inside library/table/table.h, 
   the macro Data_XXX_Information_Struct_Gen, generates the desired struct
   but does not format it well (it lacks newlines after the variable decls
   inside the struct). Find out how to make it generate the struct with 
   newlines.
4. Finish working on EMBEDDED_DATA, now called structs_common_embedded_data, we are still
   at the notecard phase but have also started a journal entry in library/notes. Additional
   tests are needed for structs_common. We need to create a directory within library/ 
   (for structs_common, we may call it "structs"). Also complete entry in GCC_NOTES about
   the struct behavior (recursion and forward declaring).
4.1 Finish working on the 11/10/21 12:36PM entry (where we wanted to explain what we
    did on the piece of printer paper).
